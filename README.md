## About Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging 
computational problems meant to be solved with computer programs. These 
problems range from simple to complex and cover a wide range of mathematical 
and computational topics. As you progress through the problems, you'll have 
the opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills and programming 
knowledge.

## Euler Problem Solutions
In this repository, you'll find solutions to Project Euler problems 
implemented in different programming languages. Each problem is solved in its 
own directory, organized by problem number. Inside each e directory are 
subdirectories of the languages that have been used to solve the 
problems. You can explore and learn from various programming approaches used to 
solve these problems. Feel welcome to reach out or discuss in theClubhou.se discord
[#programming](https://discord.com/channels/1088482651742146750/1090640789287219241). See contact options in theClubhou.se about section.

## Getting Started (QuickStart)
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

## Fork Method 
If you want a full and separate version of this repository to exist in
**your** GitHub profile, use the Fork Method. This will give you a full
clone of the entire repository and let you show off your work on your
GitHub profile.

**Note**: If you are **not** a member of [theClubhouse-Augusta](https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta)
you have to use the **Fork** method to participate. If you would like to
be added to theClubhouse-Augusta organization, ask for perms in the 
[#programming](https://discord.com/channels/1088482651742146750/1090640789287219241) channel in theClubhou.se Discord
server.

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler) into
your Github repositories.

### 2. Clone Locally
Then, clone that repository to your computer to start solving.
 ```console
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/project-euler.git
```

### 3. Run the installation script
```console
npm install 
```

### 4. Initial Setup (only once)
Now that you have everything installed, you can start solving immediately.
The first time you run the Project Euler script, it will perform a setup
function and ask you a few questions about your preferences.
```console
npm run euler
```

### 5. Code Your Solution (for each problem)
Start a new Project Euler solution by 1 of 2 options:

   * run the command `npm run euler` 
or `node index.js`

   * provide command-line arguments to the script to skip 
interactive mode  
Examples:
`npm run euler 5 javascript` or 
`node index.js 9 cpp`

Either option will create all of the correct files and
folders, and a README file in your solution directory. Keep your
work inside your own solution directory.

### 6. Submit PR
Once you're happy with your solution, submit a PR to the main repository
at [theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler](https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler) to get your branch
merged in to the primary repository. 

## Contributor Method (best)
If you are a member of theClubhou.se and want a slightly easier workflow,
we recommend the **Contributor Method**. If you are already a member of the
GitHub [theClubhouse-Augusta organization](https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/members), then you can 
skip the **Fork the Repository* step above and work directly from the main
repository.

**Note**: If you are an **active** member of [theClubhouse-Augusta](https://theclubhou.se) and
need to be added to the GH Organization, ask to be added in the Discord server at
[#programming](https://discord.com/channels/1088482651742146750/1090640789287219241).

## Contributions other than Euler problems
This repository is meant to be focused on Euler problem solving and a wide range of 
programming languages. Adding input on problems, solutions, and languages is welcome 
inside any readme file within the eulers directory. Anyone can contribute reviews to PRs.
Discussions on theClubhou.se Discord server [#programming](https://discord.com/channels/1088482651742146750/1090640789287219241) are welcome.

Other contributions will only be considered once there are tests in place to ensure
persisting functionality for all existing features. If you are interested in assisting
with that, reach out to [Repo Initiator](https://github.com/asterihoku) to discuss. *ONLY AFTER tests are in place:*

If you have a different idea for a new feature or contribution:
1. Create a separate branch just for this work
2. Submit a PR to the main repository with:
   * Details about your contribution
   * Proof of tests passing

## Administrative
If you ever need to "resync" our local list of problems with Project Euler,
you can run the command listed below to pull down the most recent list of 
problems.
```console
npm run sync
```
This command will fetch the full list of problems from 
https://projecteuler.net/minimal=problems and store them as a JSON object in
`problems.js`.
