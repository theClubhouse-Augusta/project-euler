# AsteriHoku - 14. Longest Collatz Sequence
## Euler Solution in csharp
https://projecteuler.net/problem=14 

This is the Project Euler solution for [14. Longest Collatz Sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)
written by AsteriHoku in csharp.

## Problem Description
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

* $n \\to n/2$ ($n$ is even)
* $n \\to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence: $$13 \\to 40 \\to 20 \\to 10 \\to 5 \\to 16 \\to 8 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 1.$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
